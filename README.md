# open_quantum

Note: This is a QIntern 2025 project, where my work is described from slides #18 of ([google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wC-E8Q7QXHkpxE-H3ZaGPawCkjjZArL0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105722851322355478766&rtpof=true&sd=true) or [canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGwO5DYsm4/U3tK3NYEO5IPMTfkXRqe-A/view?utm_content=DAGwO5DYsm4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h8be13a858e)) onwards.
